# Graduate_Visualization

A D3.js project visualizing Canadian Postsecondary graduates, created using the dataset [Postsecondary graduates, by field of study, program type, credential type, and gender](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710001201) from Statistics Canada.

The project can be viewed in action [here.](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~hbarss/GraduateVisualization/4166project.html)

My goal with this project was to create data visualizations that would give a user insight into the popularity of different fields of study, the university and college student population in each province, the gender balance in post-secondary education, and how these things have changed over two decades. 
Namely, I hoped the system could be used to answer the following questions:
- What are the most popular fields of study in different provinces and the territories? Least popular?
- What are the most popular fields of study in Canada as a whole? Least popular?
- Is there any correlation between geo-economic features of different provinces and the number of postsecondary graduates in related fields? e.g. Atlantic provinces with ocean-related disciplines, Prairie provinces with agricultural disciplines, provinces with a large metropolitan population and more clerical disciplines like business, tech, or law
- What fields of study are most popular for men? What fields are most popular for women?
- What fields of study are male-dominated? What fields of study are female-dominated? Are there any with a fairly even split?
- How has the number of graduates increased or decreased each year since the 1990s? for: Canada, each province, as a whole, each field
- How many university graduates vs. college graduates are there in each province and in Canada?
